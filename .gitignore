## Dependency and Module Cache
# Dependency cache (Go Module Mirror Cache)

# Go module cache (usually found in $GOPATH/pkg/mod, but sometimes local)
/pkg/mod/

# Generated code and files that should not be tracked
# NOTE: Fabrica generates code into specific folders (e.g., pkg/resources, cmd/server). 
# You should track the source files (like cmd/server/main.go and the resource structs) 
# but exclude large, auto-generated output files or databases.
# If your storage is file-based (common in development), exclude the storage files:
/storage/*.db
/storage/*.json
